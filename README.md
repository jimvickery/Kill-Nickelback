# Kill-Nickelback
Define an array that contains arrays. Each array should contain two strings:

The name of an artist
A song by that artist
Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback. You can see a list of their greatest hits on Amazon.

songs = [
    ['Nickelback', 'How You Remind Me'],
    ['Will.i.am', 'That Power'],
    ['Miles Davis', 'Stella by Starlight'],
    ['Nickelback', 'Animals']
]
Using array manipulation methods, create a new array that contains all songs that were not performed by Nickelback.
